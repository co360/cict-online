  Going Mobile! 
</p>
<p>With the support of the Parents-Teachers Association (PTA) of the college, student Android apps and games for projects and theses can now be published on Google Play. This initiative aims to promote students and showcase their skills in developing globally competitive apps - they can also reference it to their Curriculum Vitae (CV) when they look for a job. More apps will be published soon so stay tuned.</p>
