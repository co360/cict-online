Information and Communications Technology has penetrated the core of societal and individual lives. Its development is changing the course of all other technologies. ICT has now become less of a choice and more of a requirement for individuals and societies concerned with competitiveness in the international arena.

To address the needs of providing the national and international market with ICT professionals, the University offered the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology and Bachelor of Science in Information Management programs in the first semester of AY 1998–1999 under the Institute of Mass Communications, now College of Mass Communications. It produced its first batch of graduates in March 2002.

With the establishment of the Institute of Information and Communications Technology, the two (2) programs were transferred from CMC to IICT. By virtue of BOR Resolution №34, s. 2002, the Institute of Information and Communications Technology was established. Hence, effective 1st semester of AY 2002–2003, the BSIT and BSIM degree programs were offered under the IICT.

In 2003, the Commission on Higher Education through its Regional Office 6 had been conducting widespread dissemination, monitoring and evaluation of IT Education programs throughout the region, stressing adherence of all schools to CHED Memo Order №25, Series 2001 known as “New Policies and Standards in Information Technology Education. Thus, the Institute reviewed its BSIT and BSI curricula and came up with recommendations for curriculum revision to conform to the minimum requirements set by CMO №25, S. 2001. With approval from the Board of Regents, the revised BSIT and BSIM replaced the 1998 curricula starting 1st Semester, AY 2004–2005.

As IICT awaits the completion of the construction of the IICT Building (fronting the Rizal Hall) in June 2006, its office, faculty room, and laboratories are temporarily housed at the right wing of the Quezon Hall.

In December 2006, CHED issued Memorandum Order 53, Series of 2006, known as “Policies and Standards in Information Technology Education”. The said CMO aims to rationalize IT education in the country and keep pace with the demands of global competitiveness.

The institute also established linkages along the way. They include local and international partners as well as government units.

In Aprill 22, 2016. Resolution №43–2016 was adopted by the University converting the Institute of Information and Communications Technology (IICT) into the College of Information and Communications Technology (CICT).

As ICT is every dynamic, CHED recognizes the need to be responsive according to the current needs of the country. This new policies and standards (PS) provides a minimum standard for higher education institutions offering or intending to offer quality ITE programs, and was developed with consultations from all stakeholders, from the academe to the industry.
