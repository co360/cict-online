In April 22, 2016 a new resolution was adopted by the University converting the Institute of Information and Communications Technology (IICT) into the College of Information and Communications Technology (CICT) - a call for a new logo for the college was announced. Many versions were submitted and finally, the CICT faculty and selected Alumni approved a design that was created by a former faculty of the college.

Using a play-on-type and reconstruction method, CICT text was converted into the main emblem of the college this emblem is also called the CICT eye-con.

In addition to the main emblem, a shield was also added to reflect the strength and stature of the college in the University. The USB laurel reflects the universality of the college. The USB's tree like branches suggest growth, collaboration and outreach. Its laurel ornament appearance represents prestige/achievement.
