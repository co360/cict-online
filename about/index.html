            monitoring and evaluation of IT Education programs throughout the region, stressing adherence of all schools
            to CHED Memo Order No. 25, Series 2001 known as “New Policies and Standards in Information Technology Education.
            Thus, the Institute reviewed its BSIT and BSI curricula and came up with recommendations for curriculum revision
            to conform to the minimum requirements set by CMO No. 25, S. 2001. With approval from the Board of Regents, the
            revised BSIT and BSIM replaced the 1998 curricula starting 1st Semester, AY 2004-2005.</p>
